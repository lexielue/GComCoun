**"One Vote, Forever Fed" -- 2026 Minnesota Ballot Initiative**

A full-stack analytics and management dashboard for Minnesota's statewide school greenhouse program, tracking pilot statistics, endowment data, funding sources, and strategic timeline events.

## What Is This?

The Gaia Commons Council is building a program to place 1,200 greenhouses at Minnesota schools with proper infrastructure and space, feeding 900,000 students year-round fresh produce. Funded by a $5 billion perpetual endowment generating $225 million per year, the program creates 2,400 permanent jobs and eliminates 6,553 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually from reduced food transportation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Scale Dashboard**: View metrics across Pilot (6 schools), Statewide (1,200 greenhouses), National (130K schools), and Global (1M schools) scales
- **Funding Calculator**: Interactive breakdown of $8.65B funding sources with adjustable contribution rates
- **Endowment Modeling**: $5B perpetual endowment at 4.5% annual draw = $225M/year forever
- **Climate Impact Metrics**: Conservative, research-backed numbers (EPA methodology) for CO2 avoided, water saved, and truck-miles eliminated
- **Cluster Builder**: Interactive 4-step wizard for designing custom greenhouse pilot programs
- **Twin Metals Mining Alternative**: Side-by-side comparison of permanent greenhouse jobs vs. temporary foreign-owned mining jobs near the Boundary Waters
- **Growth Pathway**: Detailed scaling projections from 6 pilot schools to 1 million globally
- **Multi-Language Support**: English, Spanish, Somali, and Hmong translations
- **Export Options**: PDF, Excel, and CSV export functionality
- **Ballot Presentation Mode**: Full-screen presentation slides for public events
